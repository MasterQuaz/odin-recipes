<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Pulled pork is very easy to make, especially if you have a slow
    cooker. Slow cooking holds in all the moisture during cooking and
    slowly will break down the connective tissue, so that the meat
    ends up so tender that it easily shreds apart with the touch of a 
    fork. Chili Rubbed Pulled Pork is a tender, juicy, and flavorful
    meat that can be used for tacos, nachos, salads, and more!
